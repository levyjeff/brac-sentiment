       "{'Atlanta': 'Local officials are preparing to lobby members of the federal Base Realignment and Closure Commission, who are expected in Atlanta next month.\\n\\nCommission members will be in town June 30 to hear the pitch to keep Fort Gillem open.\\n\\n\"Everyone\\'s pretty much got one shot at it,\" said Forest Park Mayor Chuck Hall. \"After that, it\\'s up to the commission.\"\\n\\nDefense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recommends that Fort Gillem in northeastern Clayton County, Fort McPherson in East Point, the Naval Air Station in Cobb County and the Naval Supply Corps School in Athens be closed. They are among the 33 major military facilities nationwide that may be shut down as part of the 2005 BRAC process.\\n\\nDefense officials are hoping to streamline the number of military bases around the country as they reorganize the nation\\'s military. Four other BRAC rounds -- 1998, 1995, 1993 and 1991 -- closed 97 bases.\\n\\nThis year\\'s BRAC round would close Fort Gillem, with six Army groups now at the base moving to other bases around the Southeast. The Georgia Army National Guard would get a new home at the old base. A few existing active Army units would remain, as would a new, state-of-the-art, forensic crime investigation laboratory that will serve the entire Defense Department.\\n\\nGeorgia\\'s congressional delegation has already begun lobbying commission members, who will decide over the next three months whether there will be any changes in the recommended list.\\n\\nClayton County and other affected communities will rally to keep their local bases open. Army officials estimate that 1,824 jobs -- 737 of those indirectly related to Fort Gillem -- would be lost, but closing the base would save the Defense Department $421.5 million over the next 20 years.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a $671 million economic impact that\\'s generated with Fort Gillem,\" said U.S. Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.). \"That\\'s what it means to us, so we will be prepared to tell the story.\"\\n\\nHall estimated a base on the BRAC list has only a 15 percent chance of getting off.\\n\\nLobbying efforts in the past have saved one Georgia base -- Moody Air Force in Valdosta when it was initially on BRAC\\'s list in 1991.',\n",
       " 'Baltimore 1': 'While officials in Maryland have publicly welcomed the prospect of gaining 6,600 federal jobs through the military base realignment proposed by the Pentagon, independent planners and activists say the move threatens to worsen the ills of suburban sprawl in the Greater Washington area, which includes Baltimore.\\n\\n\"This is a region that\\'s already grappling with crushing traffic congestion and all of the associated problems, air pollution and other issues,\" said Don Chen, executive director of Smart Growth America, a national growth-management advocacy group based in Washington. \"This would make it much more difficult for local governments to get control over those issues.\"\\n\\nThe Pentagon\\'s proposal would move tens of thousands of jobs from the District of Columbia and its inner suburbs to outlying bases such as Fort Meade and Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland - to communities far less accessible by public transportation and already straining to cope with the growth they are experiencing.\\n\\nMoreover, there is unlikely to be much federal aid to accompany the shifts. In previous base realignments, the Pentagon has given affected communities $280 million in aid, and other federal agencies have provided $3 billion. But the bulk of the aid in the past has gone into helping to clean up and redevelop bases that are closed.\\n\\nThe costs of accommodating base expansion are generally left to local and state government. In Maryland, the cost of expanded roads and mass transit alone could easily be tens of millions of dollars.\\n\\nThe nation\\'s capital and its neighboring states have weathered base closings and expansions before, but this one is potentially more disruptive because many job shifts are being made to satisfy new Pentagon regulations requiring that military workplaces be set back from streets, with secure parking areas, to shield them from potential terrorist attacks.\\n\\nMore than 20,000 jobs are being moved out of the district and its inner suburbs - away from offices readily accessible by the Washington area\\'s Metro rail network, which transports 700,000 riders every weekday.\\n\\nIt\\'s clear that the number of military and civilian jobs beyond the Capital Beltway would grow, where workers are less able to commute by mass transit, said David Robertson, executive director of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a regional planning agency.\\n\\n\"The federal government primarily is looking for what enhances the security of Department of Defense facilities and what\\'s the most cost-effective solution for the federal taxpayer,\" Robertson said. \"I don\\'t think the BRAC [Base Realignment and Closure Commission] process considers other issues like affordable housing, air quality and transportation.\"\\n\\nThe Washington regional planning agency is racing to get a handle on the traffic shifts and other potential impacts of the base realignment so that local officials there can attempt to influence it before it\\'s completed.\\n\\nThe regional planning counterpart for Baltimore apparently hasn\\'t given the issue much thought yet.\\n\\n\"It\\'s so fresh and new, we really haven\\'t played that scenario out,\" said Harvey S. Bloom, transportation director for the Baltimore Metropolitan Council.\\n\\nDru Schmidt-Perkins, executive director of 1000 Friends of Maryland, a group that advocates development in and around cities to reduce traffic and the loss of open space, said: \"What we\\'ve done is take those people who are largely on transit and move them to nontransit spots. That\\'s not going the right direction.\"\\n\\nWashington and Baltimore are already among the most traffic-clogged cities in the country. Capital-area residents had the third-longest commutes, and Baltimore the 17th-longest, in the latest survey by the Texas Transportation Institute. Both areas also suffer from unhealthy levels of ozone air pollution in summer, much of it from automobile emissions.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one thing to close a base and try to find a way to reuse it, but it\\'s another to reshuffle the employment and put it into places that aren\\'t prepared to take it,\" said Arthur Nelson, associate director of Virginia Tech\\'s Metropolitan Institute, a development research center in Alexandria.\\n\\nOne of those places is Fort Belvoir in Virginia, about 16 miles south of the district, which would receive 18,000 relocated workers under the Pentagon plan. With 24,000 already working there, the base is the largest employer in Fairfax County. Elected officials representing the county have said the roads serving the base are already inadequate.\\n\\nThe Metro rail system might be able to extend its Blue Line five to eight miles south from Springfield to serve Fort Belvoir, a transit agency spokeswoman said. But the projected cost, based on a study done a few years ago, was $600 million to $800 million.\\n\\nIn Maryland, James F. Ports Jr., deputy transportation secretary, said the state is working on plans for road widening and other upgrades to improve access to military bases.\\n\\nPorts said state officials would work with local representatives to address the congestion that might come from increased traffic at Fort Meade, which is projected to add 5,361 jobs, and Aberdeen, which is expected to gain 2,176 jobs.\\n\\nBut transit is likely to be more limited at both bases. Though Aberdeen and Fort Meade lie along Maryland\\'s MARC commuter rail line from Perryville to Washington, the state-run service is straining to handle only a fraction of the riders Washington\\'s Metro network does, according to Eugene Peterson, president of the Transit Riders League. Trains are crowded and breakdowns too frequent, he contends.\\n\\n\"You start adding a few more bodies to a service that\\'s already taxed, and you\\'ve got a problem,\" said Peterson, who predicted that the jobs shift would add to the region\\'s traffic gridlock if MARC and other transit options are not beefed up to serve the bases.\\n\\nGerrit Knaap, director of the National Center for Smart Growth Research and Education at the University of Maryland, College Park, said that while the base realignment no doubt disrupts the plans local officials have made to manage their communities\\' growth, it doesn\\'t have to be disastrous.\\n\\n\"It just highlights the need for regional planning,\" Knaap said. \"And the sooner we prepare ourselves to meet that need, the better off we\\'re going to be.\"',\n",
       " 'Baltimore 2': 'Like many federal workers driving from the Baltimore suburbs into Washington every day, Marshall Hudson picks his poison - the Beltway, New York Avenue or Massachusetts Avenue - based on the 7:15 a.m. radio traffic report.\\n\\nOn a good day, he gets to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in an hour - a dream commute compared with the one he would have if the Pentagon closes his office in Bethesda and moves it to Fort Belvoir, Va., as part of a nationwide shuffling and consolidating of military resources.\\n\\nThe shake-up could bring thousands of new jobs to Maryland and shift thousands of others out of state.\\n\\nThat has civilian Defense Department workers fretting. Some say they\\'ll be forced to buy new cars, adjust their work schedules or even move across the state line to make their lives easier.\\n\\nOthers say they\\'ll retire to avoid the hassle.\\n\\nChange is a concept foreign to many federal workers in the Baltimore-Washington region. The concentration of defense contractors, military bases and government offices within an hour of the Pentagon has allowed many employees to climb the pay scale without the rootlessness that accompanies military life.\\n\\nThe base realignment proposal outlined this month could disrupt that for many workers - and not just in Maryland.\\n\\nThe plan, the first round of base closings in a decade, is projected to save $50 billion over 20 years. The Pentagon is recommending that 180 military installations nationwide be shut down, including 33 large bases. Hundreds of other installations would see staffing swell or shrink.\\n\\nIf Hudson\\'s employer, which analyzes military satellite images, is relocated as recommended, he will have to leave his home in Bowie by 6 a.m. to avoid rush-hour congestion on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge crossing into Virginia.\\n\\nNew housing concerns\\n\\nHe worries that he wouldn\\'t be able to afford a house near Fort Belvoir, 16 miles south of Washington, as nice or as large as the one that he lives in now with his wife and their 2-year- old son.\\n\\n\"For a lot of my co-workers who already live in Virginia, it\\'s going to mean a shorter commute, and they\\'re thrilled,\" said Hudson, 38, who writes the internal newsletter for the agency.\\n\\n\"For those like me, who live in Annapolis, Bowie or Rockville,\" he said, \"they\\'re going to have to consider changing their lifestyle or moving.\"\\n\\nMany workers, both civilian and military, are reluctant to accept the possibility that their jobs would move. The Base Realignment and Closure Commission - or BRAC - is reviewing the Pentagon\\'s proposal, which won\\'t be final until the commission, President Bush and Congress sign off on it this fall.\\n\\nMeredith Leyva, author of Married to the Military, said that that approach is unwise. As Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld pointed out at a hearing last week, 85 percent of BRAC proposals become reality.\\n\\nLeyva, a Navy wife who has moved seven times in eight years, recommends that people contact a real estate agent now if they live in an area where many are expected to leave. Base closings create \"gluts\" of homes on the market, and prices plummet.\\n\\nPentagon officials estimate that Maryland will gain about 6,600 jobs under the realignment proposal. Virginia faces a mixed picture: a net loss of about 1,600 jobs, despite the consolidation of other jobs at places such as Fort Belvoir.\\n\\n`Busting at the seams\\'\\n\\nStephanie D. Henderson isn\\'t sure who\\'s coming or going, but she knows that the proposal would further cramp her lifestyle. When she first moved to Woodbridge, Va., more than a decade ago, her trip to meetings of the Fort Belvoir Officers\\' Wives Club took only 15 minutes.\\n\\nEvery year, it seems to get worse, and she said she expects to schedule an hour\\'s worth of travel time before each meeting once the newcomers arrive.\\n\\n\"We\\'re basically busting at the seams here,\" said Henderson, whose husband works at the post for a defense contractor. \"They\\'re putting up the houses as fast as they can.\"\\n\\nLou Brune, 50, one of Hudson\\'s co-workers, plans eventually to move from Gaithersburg to one of those new homes, but not until his two children, ages 9 and 11, graduate from high school.\\n\\n\"We just don\\'t want to disrupt their education,\" he said.\\n\\nWarren Field of the Army Test and Evaluation Center in Alexandria, Va., doesn\\'t expect any disruptions. He said he would rather retire than move to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Harford County with his command, which tests soldiers\\' weapons and communications systems.\\n\\nThree years ago, with his children grown, Field and his wife moved into a townhouse in Alexandria so that he could be a five-minute bus ride from his office and they could get rid of their second car.\\n\\nHe said he wouldn\\'t give up that convenience or the skyrocketing value of his townhouse to move to Maryland.\\n\\nTwo years off\\n\\nHis colleagues who don\\'t have the option of retiring, Field said, don\\'t have enough information right now to make decisions.\\n\\nThe move, if it happens at all, is at least two years off, and Field said he isn\\'t confident the destination will be Aberdeen.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to go wherever,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'Indianapolis': 'Gov. Mitch Daniels expressed relief this morning that the Pentagon plans to keep open the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Crane, which had been considered at risk for closing, and add 3,500 jobs at Lawrence\\'s massive Defense Finance and Accounting Service.\\n\\n\"This isn\\'t a dodged bullet,\" he said. \"It\\'s a mortar shell.\"\\n\\nThe proposed Base Realignment and Closure list didn\\'t completely spare Crane, which is slated to lose 672 of its approximately 4,000 jobs.\\n\\nOverall, Indiana would see a net gain of nearly 2,200 jobs when work is moved to Fort Benjamin Harrison in Lawrence and other bases in the state.\\n\\nThe 2005 BRAC report lists six Indiana installations targeted for closure, three that would lose workers and two that would gain.\\n\\n\"On balance, today\\'s announcement form the military is good news for Indiana,\" said Sen. Evan Bayh, a Democrat, in a press release.\\n\\nThe largest gain for the state would be in Lawrence at Fort Benjamin Harrison\\'s Defense Finance and Accounting Service in Indianapolis. The DFAS is responsible for finance and accounting activities within the Department of Defense. The fort\\'s Soldier Support Center was transferred to Jackson, S.C., as a result of the 1991 BRAC process.\\n\\nThe other gain for the state would be for Fort Wayne International Airport Air Guard Station, which is slated to add 256 civilian jobs and 57 military positions.\\n\\nCity officials are pleased the Army\\'s finance center would gain jobs under the proposal, said Melina Maniatis Kennedy, a Democrat and deputy mayor for economic development. But they\\'re also disappointed with the possible changes at Crane because of the facility\\'s potential to boost Indiana\\'s high-tech economy.\\n\\nAs one of the state\\'s installations targeted for reductions, Crane will see the loss of 672 civilian jobs plus 11 contractor positions, according to the BRAC report.\\n\\nBut Daniels, a Republican, chose to emphasize the positive side of the news for Indiana: Crane will be preserved, with its high-tech mission intact. He vowed to continue short-term efforts to lobby on Crane\\'s behalf before BRAC recommendations are final. It\\'s possible, he said, officials might reconsider their decision to cut positions at Crane. And in the long term, he said, every effort will be made to build on the base\\'s cutting-edge engineering capacity and increase its many partnerships with the private sector.\\n\\nDaniels hadn\\'t always expected BRAC to go so well for Indiana.\\n\\n\"Four months ago, this kind of outcome could not have been anticipated,\" he said. \"We have made every argument we could think of to every person who mattered or might matter.\"\\n\\nU.S. Rep. Mike Sodrel, a Republican who represents the Crane area, released a statement promising he\\'ll continue to work with officials to keep the base fully\\n\\noperational.\\n\\n\"As the specifics of the Pentagon\\'s recommendations for Crane become clearer in the next few hours or even days, I will continue to work, along with my colleagues and the state of Indiana, to see that Crane is treated fairly,\" said Sodrel, who is in his first term.\\n\\nCrane workers who lose their jobs might be able to find employment with firms expected to relocate to the new West Gate Crane Technology Park, said Terry Busch, vice president at CB Richard Ellis, which markets the park.\\n\\n\"By and large its good news for the West Gate Technology Park at Crane,\" Busch said. \"The jobs that will remain [at Crane] are the critical high tech jobs and those were exactly the jobs that this park was to support.\"\\n\\nCuts also are slated for the Hulman Regional Airport Air Guard Station in Terre Haute, which would lose 136 jobs.\\n\\nOn the list for closing is the Navy Recruiting district headquarters in Indianapolis. That would result in a loss of 27 military posts, 5 civilian jobs and 6 contracting positions. The Navy Marine Corps Reserve Center at Grissom Air Force Base in Bunker Hill would also close - a loss of seven military jobs.\\n\\nOther closures include the Newport Chemical Depot, which would eliminate 571 military and civilian jobs; the Navy Reserve Center in Evansville, a loss of seven military jobs; the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Lafayette, a loss of 21 military positions; and the U.S. Army Reserve Center in Seston, a loss of 12 military positions.\\n\\nThe national list of base closures and realignments was shorter than originally anticipated. The changes, if approved, would save the government an estimated $48.8 billion over 20 years.\\n\\nAlthough most of the recommendations are expected to be endorsed by the base closing commission, it can under certain circumstances make changes to the list.\\n\\nThe commission has until Sept. 8 to forward its final recommendations to President George Bush, who has until Sept. 23 to either accept them in total or reject them in total. If he rejects them, the commission must submit a revised report to Bush by Oct. 20, and he has until Nov. 20 to act on it.\\n\\nIf Bush approves the recommendations, then Congress must either accept or reject the list in whole.\\n\\nIndiana has been a net loser in previous BRAC rounds. But regardless how it affects particular states, Daniels said, Americans should support the BRAC process. \"We shouldn\\'t spend one dollar less than it takes to secure the defense of Americans,\" he said. \"But we shouldn\\'t spend one dollar more than is required.\"',\n",
       " 'Lubbock': 'HAWTHORNE, Nev. (AP) - For more than 50 years, this struggling desert town that proudly calls itself \"America\\'s Patriotic Home\" has held what\\'s billed as the nation\\'s biggest Armed Forces Day parade.\\n\\nSome 3,500 people turned out in early May for the celebration, complete with water fights, a watermelon-eating contest, dunk tanks and horseshoe pitching.\\n\\nBut the pride masked fears: The Pentagon wants to close the nearby Army Ammunition Depot, which accounts for nearly half of all jobs in the remote Nevada town of 3,800, about 130 miles south of Reno.\\n\\n\"This base is the heart and soul of town. It\\'s going to kill the town if they do away with it,\" home-maintenance business owner Larry Grant, 43, said as tanks, torpedoes, rockets and missiles paraded past.\\n\\n\"It would basically turn this place into a ghost town,\" said Operation Desert Storm veteran John Stroud, 47.\\n\\nTo the surprise of residents and Nevada\\'s congressional delegation, the depot was included this month on the Defense Department\\'s Base Realignment and Closure list, commonly known as BRAC. A nine-member commission can change the list before it is submitted to the White House and Congress this fall.\\n\\nMany residents attending the Armed Forces Day festivities sported T-shirts reading \"No BRAC - No Ghost Town - NO WAY!!\"\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t have people living here, there\\'s no one to buy,\" said Dean Shellenbarger, 40, a supermarket clerk. \"Sooner or later you just have a huge hole in the ground.\"\\n\\n\"I wonder if we\\'ll even have a school left,\" said sixth-grade teacher Christy Grant, 41.\\n\\nAlthough it sits on sagebrush-covered desert more than 200 miles from the ocean, the 147,230-acre depot opened as a Naval Undersea facility for submarine munitions in 1930. It features more than 2,400 bunkers that hold bombs, mortar shells and other munitions, and has shipped explosives for conflicts from World War II to the war in Iraq.\\n\\nToday, Hawthorne seems frozen in its heyday era of World War II, a pit stop town of motels, gas stations and fast-food places framed by miles of bunkers. Travelers passing through on U.S. Highway 95, which doubles as the town\\'s main drag, are greeted by a huge American flag flying from a 150-foot pole.\\n\\nBut the Pentagon says moving the depot\\'s storage and recycling functions to the Tooele Army Depot in Utah would cut duplication and save money.\\n\\nSupporters of the Hawthorne depot say the BRAC recommendation grossly underestimates the facility\\'s economic impact on the town and neglects cleanup costs that would total more than $400 million. They also say it fails to take into account the facility\\'s superior ability to store and ship ammunition, and to decontaminate and recycle military explosives for use by the mining and construction industries.\\n\\n\"All we want is a fair shake and the true numbers presented,\" Stroud said.\\n\\nThe depot commander, Lt. Col. Johnny Summers, warns that Congress upheld 85 percent of recommendations in earlier rounds of base closures.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not good odds, but we\\'re cautiously optimistic,\" Summers said.\\n\\nThe depot\\'s 534 workers are nearly half of the town\\'s 1,200-member work force, and the depot also accounts for many indirect support jobs in the community. The town\\'s second- biggest employer is the El Capitan casino.\\n\\nHawthorne has been hanging by frayed economic threads for years because of the drought-threatened fishery in scenic but shrinking Walker Lake, mine closures and layoffs at the depot. At its zenith, it employed more than 5,600 people, and more than 2,000 military personnel were stationed here.\\n\\nShelley Hartmann, executive director of the Mineral County Economic Development Authority, said Hawthorne \"is not going to become a ghost town.\"',\n",
       " 'Norfolk': 'FORT MONROE - There was good news in the bad news.\\n\\nAfter centuries of standing guard, Fort Monroe may fade into history, its 3,500 jobs scattered and its fate uncertain.\\n\\nBut there\\'s a contract, inked ages ago by some unknown, long-forgotten fellow.\\n\\nIt seems that back in the early 1800s, Virginia only loaned the federal government the bulk of the Army fort\\'s 570-acre property. The written agreement says that if the military ever vacates, as it now proposes to do, title to the land comes home to the commonwealth.\\n\\nSuch things aren\\'t always a given, especially now, as the Department of Defense seeks ways to save money in a costly time of war. Many of the land deals that established military bases across the country are a hodgepodge of federal purchases and state give aways. In those cases, the future of the property in this era of base closure and downsizing is up to Defense officials.\\n\\nThat could mean a sale to the highest bidder. In California, surrounding communities wrangled for years over rights to the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. A private developer recently won the place for $1 billion.\\n\\n\"That may be the golden parachute for Fort Monroe,\" Paul Taibl said, \"that some legal entity back in antiquity had the foresight to write a good contract.\"\\n\\nTaibl is the director of policy for Business Executives for National Security, a Washington, D.C.-based organization interested in balancing strong defense with efficient government. Its members keep a close eye on base closings. Calls came to Taibl from concerned communities nationwide on Friday after the Pentagon released a list of 33 bases recommended for closing under the base realignment and closure process.\\n\\n\"You guys are lucky in other ways, too,\" Taibl said of Virginia\\'s only base targeted for closure. \"Fort Monroe is a nice chunk of real estate. I just got off the phone with people from Ellsworth, S.D . There\\'s just not that much economic activity there to replace what they might be losing.\"\\n\\nIndeed, most agree that Fort Monroe\\'s real estate is now worth untold millions - which could translate into a bright future even without uniforms.\\n\\nThe post juts out like a bent arm into the Chesapeake Bay, within sight of where the Hampton Roads Bridge- Tunnel touches the Peninsula. It\\'s surrounded by the city of Hampton - where leaders plan to fight to keep the base open but hope to take its property within their fold if they fail.\\n\\nMayor Ross Kearney said he\\'s talked with Gov. Mark Warner.\\n\\n\"He\\'s promised us that Hampton will be an active participant in whatever happens there,\" Kearney said.\\n\\nRichmond is making no other pledges.\\n\\n\"Multiple steps will have to be gone through to see where it ends up,\" said George Foresman, an assistant to the governor. \"The bottom line is, we want to be able to get the property into the most effective reuse as soon as possible.\"\\n\\nHampton\\'s mayor said developers are tracking the BRAC process, and have been knocking on the city\\'s door for several months now.\\n\\n\"Some of the proposals have been so outstanding,\" Kearney said.\\n\\nHe declined to share any details, saying only that most ideas involved high-end homes or commercial ventures.\\n\\n\"It won\\'t be a flea market,\" Kearney said. \"No Get-n-Go. No Motel 8s.\"\\n\\nHe said Hampton has formed a commission to consider the options.\\n\\nThe old fort is full of waterfront views, sandy beaches, weathered stone, seasoned wood and red-brick, antebellum homes. First fortified in 1609, the fort\\'s life span covers the entire military history of America. It\\'s listed as a National Historic Landmark.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the top tier in this country,\" said Kathleen Kilpatrick, director of the state\\'s department of historic resources. \"The Army has been an amazing steward of the place. Whatever happens to Fort Monroe, we must continue to take care of this treasure.\"\\n\\nAge does have its drawbacks. Upkeep on the old buildings runs the Army about $14 million a year. And any developer would have to deal with preservation guidelines. Such rules, however, do not offer blanket protection against change.\\n\\n\"The law only requires that diligent effort be made to avoid or minimize impact upon historic structures,\" Kilpatrick explained. \"No one wants to see them standing empty. You can\\'t love them to death.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s still time to firm up any plans. If Fort Monroe stays on BRAC\\'s hit list, the Army can\\'t close it for two more years. It could take up to six years to hand over the keys. Unexploded ordnance and pollutants will have to be removed before the base can be taken out of service. Estimated cost for the clean up is $27 million.\\n\\nLand can be turned over in parcels as it becomes ready, said Roxanne Yonn, a public affairs manager for URS Corporation in Sacramento. The architectural, construction and engineering firm has been involved in numerous base clean ups and turn overs.\\n\\n\"Getting those gates down as soon as possible is always a good idea,\" Yonn said. \"Don\\'t let it look like it\\'s dying when the military moves out. A tumbleweed town is a hard image to come back from.\"\\n\\nShe has a warning: \"Strong leadership is needed. Watch out for the vultures. They\\'ll be circling.\"\\n\\nHampton\\'s mayor says he won\\'t speculate public l y on the future yet. Kearney did, say, however, that if Fort Monroe goes, it could be like \"a daughter getting married.\\n\\n\"There\\'s that disappointment that you lose her,\" he said, \"but maybe we\\'re gaining a son and a whole new family, and we\\'re just not aware of it yet.\"\\n\\n* Reach Joanne Kimberlin at (757) 446-2338 or joanne.kimberlin@ pilotonline.com.\\n\\n{DOUBLE-EDIT} THE PENTAGON\\'S PROPOSAL\\n\\nMore coverage on the base recommendations.

       " 'Norwich 1': 'NORWICH - The task is simple: Do the math and find the flaw.\\n\\nWhen the Groton submarine base was targeted for closure in 1993, the decision was overturned because of flawed numbers in the Pentagon\\'s rationale. It is the immediate strategy local officials will use again.\\n\\nIn order to convince the nine-member Base Realignment and Closure Commission to remove the Groton base from the list, local officials will have to convince commissioners the decision to close the facility \"substantially deviates\" from the prescribed criteria and Force Structure Plan.\\n\\nOver the weekend, members of the Subase Realignment Coalition began the tedious process of analyzing the Pentagon\\'s data accompanying the initial list of base closings. It is the critical first step in mounting an offensive to reverse the decision and keep Groton as the Submarine Capital of the World.\\n\\nHere\\'s a look at the key players and the task at hand.\\n\\nMilitary value\\n\\nFour of the eight criteria used in developing the base closure list involve military value. Essentially, the Pentagon sought to identify those bases that provide the greatest value to meet future threats.\\n\\n*John Markowicz and Bill Moore: Markowicz, chairman of the Subase Realignment Coalition, and Moore, former president of the Southeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce, were instrumental in the 1993 BRAC in identifying flawed reasoning in that decision. Based on available data, they have already developed the military value of the Groton sub base and will be primarily responsible for analyzing the Pentagon data related to the Groton facility.\\n\\n*Mick O\\'Beirne: Another key player in the 1993 BRAC, O\\'Beirne is a retired Navy veteran who served in a command position at Kings Bay, Ga. Both the sub school and part of the Groton sub fleet are slated for reassignment to Kings Bay. O\\'Beirne will be responsible for analyzing the Pentagon\\'s data as it relates to that facility.\\n\\n*Denny Hicks: A retired Navy submariner, Hicks held a command position at the Norfolk naval base in Virginia, where the remainder of the Groton sub fleet is scheduled to be reassigned, along with the consolidation of the Northeast Regional Navy Headquarters with the Atlantic Fleet\\'s Headquarters based in Norfolk. Hicks will have the primary task of reviewing the Pentagon data as it relates to Norfolk.\\n\\nCost savings\\n\\nThe Pentagon estimates it will cost $680 million to close the Groton facility, resulting in a $1.6 billion saving over 20 years. The task of disputing those numbers will likely fall largely to the state\\'s congressional delegation.\\n\\n*Staff members of Democratic Sens. Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph Lieberman and U.S. Rep. Rob Simmons, R-2nd District, will examine the Pentagon\\'s estimates, looking for errors in saving estimates. The federal Government Accounting Office is scheduled to release an independent audit of the estimated cost savings in July. Specifically, environmental clean up costs will be closely scrutinized. There are a number of EPA Superfund sites at the base that could increase the estimated cost of closing the base and reduce the overall cost savings. Additionally, close examination will be given to recent improvements at the base in the hopes of finding flaws that might further reduce estimated savings.\\n\\nEconomic impact\\n\\nAlthough not a primary criteria, it is one of the eight considerations the Pentagon was to use in developing its list. Local officials will attempt to identify Pentagon data that significantly underestimates the economic impact.\\n\\n*Gov. M. Jodi Rell will assemble a \"strike force\" of state agency representatives and business leaders to find flaws in the Pentagon estimates. The strike force will develop a more comprehensive economic impact study that likely would show a greater economic impact than that of the Pentagon\\'s.',\n",
       " 'Norwich 2': 'WASHINGTON - While the initial focus of the state has been on the Groton Submarine Base, it is not the only military facility in Connecticut targeted in this round of the Base Realignment and Closure process.\\n\\nThree of the state\\'s nine U.S. Army Reserve Centers also were targeted for closure and the Connecticut Air National Guard\\'s 103rd Fighter Wing was slated for realignment.\\n\\nClosing the reserve centers in Middletown, New Haven and Fairfield would mean a loss of 56 civilian and military jobs. The potential loss to the Air Guard is 70 civilian jobs - and the wing\\'s 17 aircraft.\\n\\n\"At this point, the Connecticut National Guard is trying to determine and assess what realignment actually means and what the impact will be to the Air Guard and the state,\" Lt. Col. John Whitford said Monday.\\n\\nThe Pentagon is recommending transferring Connecticut\\'s fleet of A-10 attack jets from Bradley International Airport to Barnes Air Force Base in Westfield, Mass., a decision that would leave Connecticut as one of handful of states with no air mission or aircraft as part of its Guard component.\\n\\nThe fighter wing played a key role in the war in Iraq, flying non-stop flights to provide air cover for advancing ground troops from the onset of the fighting to the end of the major fighting. Not a single plane or member of the wing was lost.\\n\\n\"Why would you want to move an air wing from an airport?\" said Rich Harris, spokesman for Gov. M. Jodi Rell. \"It just doesn\\'t make a lot of sense.\"\\n\\nHarris said it has not been decided who will be designated to fight those portions of the base-closing recommendations. Subase Realignment Coalition Chairman John Markowicz is recommending his group focus its work on saving the base and the state take the lead on the Army and Air Guard issues.\\n\\n\"I think what we can do is provide other engaged parties with the information they would need to take the lead on those issues,\" he said.\\n\\nIn a letter to BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi, Rell said Markowicz and a designee she will appoint will serve as Connecticut\\'s primary points of contact regarding base-closing issues. Although mentioning the sub base specifically in her letter, she did not specifically address the other recommendations.\\n\\nHarris said the state has not determined how it will address the Army and Air Guard recommendations. Rell is scheduled to meet with the heads of state agencies Wednesday, including interim National Guard Adjutant General Brig. Gen. Thaddeus Martin.',\n",

The moves are intended to consolidate military operations in the U.S. and save $49 billion over 20 years.\\n\\nThe commission proposed that 7,344 personnel -- about 6,500 of them military and the rest civilians -- be relocated to Fort Lee, an Army training and logistics base nestled in the heart of the Tri-Cities.\\n\\n\"We welcome them with open arms and will work with any resources to assist with the transition,\" Petersburg Mayor Annie M. Mickens said.\\n\\n\"Everyone has to be pleased that the value of Fort Lee has been recognized,\" she added.\\n\\nU.S. Rep. J. Randy Forbes, R-4th, whose district includes the military installation, agreed.\\n\\n\"The real victory [Friday] is not in the BRAC list,\" he said. \"It is in the future of Fort Lee.\"\\n\\nRecent studies show that Fort Lee contributes $860 million annually to the economies of the Tri-Cities and metro Richmond areas. In addition to those employed at the base, the installation supports 9,300 regional jobs with an annual payroll of $302.3 million.\\n\\nNew construction would cost $600 million, greatly increasing the base\\'s economic impact, said Fort Lee\\'s garrison commander, Col. John Angevine.\\n\\n\"Fort Lee is an economic engine in the region,\" said Angevine, who foresees an increase in the demand for housing, jobs and business.\\n\\nSeveral local residents expressed hope that new jobs would be created from the realignment.\\n\\n\"It\\'s what the city and area needs,\" Herman Jones said outside a Ukrop\\'s supermarket on South Crater Road in Petersburg. \"More job opportunities for young people.\"\\n\\nForbes said the proposal would also create 4,425 indirect non-governmental base support and service industry jobs.\\n\\nAt the Food Lion grocery store across the street from the Comfort Inn on state Route 36, store manager Janet Weaver sees military personnel every day.\\n\\nWhile the store\\'s existence doesn\\'t hinge entirely on Fort Lee, it would still reap the benefits of additional personnel.\\n\\n\"I would hope it would increase business by about 10 percent,\" she said.\\n\\nChang Oh, manager of U.S. Dry Cleaners, on Route 36 between downtown Petersburg and Fort Lee, said more than half of his business comes from the military.\\n\\nThe additional personnel will \"help everyone,\" he said.\\n\\nAlthough the news from the BRAC report is welcome throughout the Tri-Cities, the real celebration will take place if the changes become official.\\n\\n\"Nothing is final until the list is evaluated, but we\\'re still pretty confident,\" Mickens said.\\n\\nThe recommendations will go through a procedure that could involve substantial revisions before President Bush acts on them and sends them to Congress for approval.

       " 'San Antonio': \"The loss of a military organization at Lackland AFB known as the Cryptologic Support Group is greater than just the number of jobs involved, local technology officials said.\\n\\nThe recent report from the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, known as BRAC, recommended relocating the center to Tobyhanna Army Depot in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nThe move would cost 177 direct jobs and 199 indirect jobs, and those include many high-tech experts with advanced degrees. Workers with the Cryptologic Support Center repair and maintain computers, electronic components, radios and other equipment.\\n\\n''Even though those jobs may be relatively small in comparison to other considerations, the intellectual capital of those jobs has a multiple effect,'' said Randy Goldsmith, president of the San Antonio Technology Accelerator Initiative, a public and private technology booster group.\\n\\nThe loss of the group would be a blow to San Antonio's growing intelligence community, which is home to the Air Intelligence Agency at Lackland and the new campus of the National Security Agency, Goldsmith said. The Cryptologic Support Group works closely with the Air Intelligence Agency.\\n\\n''We're going to have to do more analysis on what their rationale is,'' said retired Air Force Brig. Gen. John Jernigan, who heads San Antonio's military missions task force. ''It's not huge, but it's a large enough number of people that if there's a counterargument, we want to make it.''\\n\\nIn a global sense, San Antonio is ''pretty happy'' with the BRAC list, Jernigan said.\\n\\nOverall, the report proposes 68 realignments at the city's four military bases, involving the loss of anywhere from 10 jobs to thousands at Wilford Hall Medical Center.\\n\\n''We're going to have to pick our battles pretty carefully,'' he said.\\n\\nA Lackland spokesman said no one was available to comment on the move Tuesday.\\n\\nThe report estimates relocating the center would cost the Defense Department $10.2 million initially, but the military would save $28 million by consolidating the operations during the next 20 years.\"}"

    "# Conclusions and Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "There is always a tradeoff in text analysis between accuracy and time/computing power. Effort spent parsing the meaning out of text has major diminishing returns, but I think it is accurate to say that it only asymptotically approaches zero for any article of sufficient size. For example, there may not be very many articles that refer only to other places (like the Lubbock, TX article on Hancock, NV), so it may not be worth our time to put a lot of effort into correcting a very small number of articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second related issue that frequently arises in the text processing space is that there are many tools and many judgment calls involved, often with very limited ability to \"prove\" one is the right approach over another. For example, here I used a pre-trained sentiment algorithm from textblob, which is a popular choice. But we could also use another library, like huggingface, which would give us access to a whole new subset of sentiment algorithms. We could also put in the effort to train our own custom algorithm, though in this case I do not think that would be worth our time, even if we had the resources for it. This makes our results harder to defend to referees, and we may have to offer multiple versions of the results using different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to another issue, that the further we go beyond the most simple approaches to text analysis, the less likely the average economist will be able to easily understand what we're doing and critique our approach. Whether buying access to the text of AWN articles will be worth our time or not is difficult to judge."
